#Triangle area the last maths function program
def trianglearea(base,height):
    print("Ok so you want the area of a triangle.....")
    print("Did you Remember the 0.5!!!")
    answer = 0.5*base*height
    print(answer) 
        

#The base is always halved or multipled by 0.5





#This time a cylinder function with proper variables
def cylindervolume(radius,height):
    print("Ok so you want the volume of a cylinder.....")
    print("Did you Remember the pi!!!")
    answer = 3.14*radius**2*height
    print(answer) 
        

#and an area to add in radius and height with , in between












#function just below here with proper maths equation
def circlearea(radius):
    print("Ok so you want the area of a circle.....")
    print("Did you Remember the r squared!!!")
    answer = 3.14*radius**2
    print(answer) 
        

#and once again remember to addd in your numbers.......










#The function is below, note the maths 4 lines down and the new ()
def circlearea(radius):
    print("Ok so you want the circumfrence of a circle.....")
    print("Did you Remember pi!!!")
